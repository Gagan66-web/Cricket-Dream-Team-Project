This program allows users to create thier Dream Team.
This is done by asking the users to enter the number of players and player types(allrounder,batsman,bowler).
Depending on the Player Type the inputs vary such(runs scored ,balls faced, score conceded ,overs done ).
After entering inputs it creates a database containg name, balls face and also calculate values from inputs(strike rate ,economy),etc and displays it to the user.
Then provides a Team rating based on the  overs faced by the team. It is also flexible as it allows to add more player,try from scratch ,etc.

Project is implemented using Mysql(Mysql.connector),Tkinter(GUI framework in python) , random module,and many user defined functions.
